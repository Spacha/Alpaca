			<p>Here I write about things I find interesting. Mostly I write for myself. For some reason it's fun to write things down; how it's been and what I have been up to. Sometimes I tend to go too much into details, but I think it's fine! It's so fun to come back years later and read my old posts. It makes me feel like it happened yesterday, yet like I would be reading somebody else's blog!</p>

			<p>Without further ado, head right in and have fun.</p>
