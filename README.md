# Alpaca
Alpaca is light but scalable PHP framework for those who like Rapid and Eloquent Web Development.

# Installation
Alpaca is in so early phase that there won't be a stable release for a while. If you are still interested to install, you need to put in some effort to manually install everything but I wish you good luck!

Have a good one 🐪
